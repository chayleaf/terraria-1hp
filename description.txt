This mod:

- makes 1hp the max possible HP value (don't worry, it will be reverted if you load your characters without this mod)
- makes heart crystals not give any bonus HP (but they still unlock progression!)
- fixes game UI not being shown when max HP is less than 19 because of a division by zero
- fixes a ROD exploit that allowed to use it infinitely if your max HP is less than 7 (well, now it just kills you if you use it while the debuff is active)

Planned:

- QoL fixes to prevent RNG instadeaths
- Maybe some configuration?
- Maybe don't override the HP of existing characters with over 1HP?
